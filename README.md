## Setup (Selfhosting Spaces!!)

1. Clone this project and create a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:
   ```bash
   # Database configuration
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/your_database
   
   # Application secret key (generate a secure random string)
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
   
   # ImgBB API key for image uploads (get from https://api.imgbb.com/)
   IMGBB_API_KEY=your-imgbb-api-key-here
   
   # WakaTime API key for Hackatime integration (optional)
   WAKATIME_API_KEY=your-wakatime-api-key-here
   
   # Groq API key for AI chat functionality (required for Orphy chat)
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
   ```
   
   **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python setup_db.py
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The application will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

## Database Schema

- **Users**: Stores user information and authentication details
- **Sites**: Stores website/script content and metadata

## VERY IMPORTANT!!!

You MUST have a db created with the correct tables or it will NOT work!! If even the tiniest table is formatted wrong, it will not start!
